    'Hi!  I am a mother, sister, daughter, friend, forever student, ritual lover and champion of expansion.   More formally, I am a trauma informed social worker and personal coach.  I have spent my career working with kids, families, and individuals in a variety of capacities.  One common thread that I have seen woven throughout my interactions is a deep desire to feel better, feel connected and to change patterns that may be contributing to an unfulfilling life. I believe we are all capable of discharging the pain and dysfunction that may exist in our bodies and inevitably control our lives.  I believe in the power of  well-timed questions asked within supportive spaces.  I believe in starting over at any point, taking a leap into the unknown and trusting our intuition.  I know feeling better is possible and I look to my own journey of healing and expansion as proof of that.';
