                            We met many years ago when our sons were in
                            preschool together and became fast friends. Since
                            that time we have seen each other through a lot of
                            life, love, loss and growth. One point of connection
                            between us is our shared commitment to doing work
                            that provides healing, growth and expansion. Not
                            just in our professional lives, but within
                            ourselves, our families, and our communities. We
                            believe all beings are capable of healing and
                            feeling well if given access to the right
                            environment, supportive services, tools and loving
                            guidance to facilitate it.

                            Our techniques are a blend of all we have learned,
                            what has been successful for others weâ€™ve served and
                            also what has worked for us personally. There is no
                            one size fits all when it comes to this special type
                            of work. We customize a plan based on the physical,
                            mental, emotional, environmental and spiritual needs
                            and priorities of each individual.

                            It has been a long time hope of ours to guide others
                            through this tender process, in a way that is truly
                            aligned for us. Out of this hope, Embody Coaching
                            and Counseling was born. Welcome! We hope you find
                            the community, connection and creative care you are
                            looking for here with us. We are so excited to work
                            together!
