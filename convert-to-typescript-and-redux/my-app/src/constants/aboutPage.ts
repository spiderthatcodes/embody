    'Hello!  I am a Philadelphia native who moved here to the desert several years ago.  I am a mother, partner and licensed professional counselor.  I am a strong believer that the personal journey, though strongly influenced by external factors, is a very personal internal journey.  In my practice, I encourage fellow soul searchers to find their own vibration.  It is my belief that you get from the universe what you put into it.  In my practice, I support clients to find the confidence to manifest what they seek as well as provide tools to navigate challenges when things do not consistently turn in their favor.  It is my hope that participation in services through Embody will lead clients to a path of clarity and hope, so that they will be empowered to step outside of their own comfort zone and test boundaries so they can ultimately find the capacity to embrace personal growth.';

    'Hi!  I am a mother, sister, daughter, friend, forever student, ritual lover and champion of expansion.   More formally, I am a trauma informed social worker and personal coach.  I have spent my career working with kids, families, and individuals in a variety of capacities.  One common thread that I have seen woven throughout my interactions is a deep desire to feel better, feel connected and to change patterns that may be contributing to an unfulfilling life. I believe we are all capable of discharging the pain and dysfunction that may exist in our bodies and inevitably control our lives.  I believe in the power of  well-timed questions asked within supportive spaces.  I believe in starting over at any point, taking a leap into the unknown and trusting our intuition.  I know feeling better is possible and I look to my own journey of healing and expansion as proof of that.';
